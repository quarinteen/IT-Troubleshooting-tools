Tools to make your job easier

If you work in IT then you probably spend a good amount of time trying to find tools every once in a while that do just one thing nothing else you have found will do. I often find my self writing tools just to do one or two things. I figured I would start posting them here for other people to use. I hope you find something in here to help you as well.

I created this repository on 09/02/2016. Over time I will add more things.
