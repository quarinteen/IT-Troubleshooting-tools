#Host Name and IP Resolver

I wrote this tool because in my world of working with firewalls I dont care abut host names. I want IP addresses. I looked for a tool 
that would just take a list of host names and covert it to a list of IP addresses. I never cound find exactly what I wanted so I wrote 
this. It has two functions. You feed it a txt file with hostnames each on a new line and tell it to resolve the IP. I also wrote it to do
the reverse just in case. Give it IP addresses and it will do its best to pull the FQDN. 

This made my life easier. I hope it does the same for you.
